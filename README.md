### Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Challenge

This repository originated in a university project in winter term 2023/2024. We did forecasting about DAX returns (German stock index) and German energy consumption. Forecasts here are on probabilistc quantile level, instead of "point" forecasts. Doing so, statistical methods as well as machine learning models were employed. Forecasts were due each week in the term.

Employed models:
- Quantile Regression
- LSTM (with final dense layer for quantile prediction)
- XGBoost
